- [soundfont](https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont) (once streaming audio is setup)
- use sfx (with dynamic param changes, once streaming audio is setup)
- [faust](https://faust.grame.fr/) would be really neat for sound-processing. If I could load dsp files directly, that would be sick, but precompiled might be ok for most things. Also, their gui functions are inspiring.
- [cmajor](https://cmajor.dev/) is also nice for instruments/effects, seems a bit simpler, and can interop with faust.
